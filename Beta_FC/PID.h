/*  Proportional–integral–derivative controller (PID controller) is a control loop feedback mechanism.

    PID controller calculates an "error" value as the difference between a measured process variable and a desired setpoint. 
    The controller attempts to minimize the error by adjusting the process control inputs.
    
    Input = Kinematics or sensor input
    Output = PID output
    SetPoint = Desired output
    windupGuard = maximum and minimum constrain on I term
    
    Empty constructor will allow us to declare PID object globally anywhere before the setup() function
    This will allow us to feed PID settings and other variables when they are ready
    (in our case, after EEPROM has been initialized / read into variables)
