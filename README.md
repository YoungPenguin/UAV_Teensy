# UAV_Teensy
***IMPORTANT!!!***
 - ***Make sure all inputs and sensors are set in the same direction as the code is written***
 - ***TAKE YOUR F''''' PROPELLERS OFF!***
 - ***DON'T BE STUPID***

UAV PID control with teensy 3.6

# Main Goal 
This project will be made highly scaleble, so it's not restricted to a Hexacopter as documented in this project it can also be applyed to Quad- Hexa- octo- and so on..- copter.
