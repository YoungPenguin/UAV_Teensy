# UAV_Teensy
# Covid-19 update 28/03/2020
Due to Covid-19, this project will be carried out on a more theoretical level than initially expected. So if you want to use this controller for your own project, then you will have to wait a little longer for controller confirmation.

****description comming at the end of this project: 26/6/2020***

***IMPORTANT!!!***
 - ***Make sure all inputs and sensors are set in the same direction as the code is written***
 - ***TAKE YOUR F''''' PROPELLERS OFF!***
 - ***DON'T BE STUPID***

UAV PID control with teensy 3.6

# Main Goal 
This project will be made highly scaleble, so it's not restricted to a Hexacopter as documented in this project it can also be applyed to Quad- Hexa- octo- and so on..- copter.


# The UAV used for testing in this project 
Hardware:
- Teensy 3.6
- teensy prop shield
- Taranis Transmitter/ reciver
- Propeller: carbon 13.5x5.5
- Motor: turnigy 3508-700

UAV specs:

- Configuration: hex x copter
- Weight without batteries: 2000g
- Arm length: 400mm


Data processing tools used:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) used for extracting data.
- [Processing](https://processing.org/) used for real-time data visualization.
- [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/) used for simulation.
